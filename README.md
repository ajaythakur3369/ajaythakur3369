### Jai Hind, Everyone! üëã

I'm Ajay Thakur (‡§Ö‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§†‡§æ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞), a student at IIT Madras [Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering] and an Associate at Goldman Sachs, also a proud NCC Cadet who served as the Senior Under Officer, NCC, India (PM Rally || YEP - Russia), [JD + SD] of the Army Wing.

I have a keen interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics.

The best part of my life is my cherished childhood memories.

My inspiration is my H. H. Resp. Guardian.
