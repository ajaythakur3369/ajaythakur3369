### Hi there üëã

I am Ajay Thakur (‡§Ö‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§†‡§æ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞), a self-taught student at IIT Madras. I joined Goldman Sachs as an Analyst this year.

I have a keen interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics.

I love my bicycle, "Dariya (‡§¶‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ)" which has traveled the world with me.
